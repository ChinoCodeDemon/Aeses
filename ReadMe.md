# Activity Enhancing Spam Erasing System
Aeses is focused on enhancing the Activity of a community and erasing possible spam.
I will try to make Aeses powerful enough to be a standalone tool.

## Dependencies
1. [python](https://www.python.org/)
2. [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html)

## Goal of this project
This will also be a bit of a to-do list for me.
The aspects of moderation and spam protection are most important to me, but i am also open for suggestions.

### Moderation Goals
- Fully integrated spam protection
- Kick, Ban, Strike commands

### Activity Enhancing Goals
- Automatic messages in dead main channels.
- Daily messages (questions, statements or images)
- Giveaway functionality (picking people)

### Configuration Goals
- Messages for moderation commands should be fully configurable.
